# software_engineering_database

This is the project site for my final project for COSC 61: Database System that I took during summer 2023 with Professor Adam Goldstein. My goal is to find interesting datasets from the internet, design and build a database out of the datasets, and explore findings using SQL queries.

Please checkout the branches for milestone submissions.
