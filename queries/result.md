    Synthesis:

    These 8 companies are all great choices for the student, since they made to the Fortune 500 rankings. Among them, Apple seems like the best choice if we evaluate revenues, profits, and market values.

    Synthesis:

    There are many attributes with which we can evaluate the prospectives of a city. If we care most about "survivability", which I refer to the mean salary for software developers in that city divided by the sum of average cost of living and average rent, we see that Wichata gives an incredible survivability of 58.8. Of course, we need to consider the size of the city and how easy it is to find a job there. The bar graphs show the number of software development jobs in the city, and we can see that New York and Jersey City both have a lot of jobs available.
